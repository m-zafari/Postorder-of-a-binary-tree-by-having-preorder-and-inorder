this program takes the preorder and inrorder of a binary tree and outputs its postorder.

Binary tree numbers are distinct.

Input
First comes the number N the number of vertices of the tree. 
In the next two lines, each line contains N numbers separated by spaces, which represent the preorder and interorder representations of the tree, respectively.
1 ≤ n ≤10^4

Output
n numbers separated by spaces on a single line, which represent the postorder representation of the corresponding tree.
